This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is
A US gas prices dashboard the user is building as their second coding project. Three pages planned:
- `index.html` (home) — Leaflet map; click a state → current price + 12-month trend
- `news/index.html` — recent gas/oil news via GNews (works from any browser, including GitHub Pages — NewsAPI's free tier is localhost-only so we don't use it). Country dropdown highlights articles mentioning the selected place; URL accepts `?country=NAME` for deep links from map popups.
- `dashboard/index.html` — national average, top/bottom states, charts via Chart.js (v2)

The eventual "click anywhere in the world" vision needs a small backend service — the user rents Hetzner servers and is willing to host one. The plan is to ship US-only first as a pure static page (browser → EIA directly), then layer in a backend for international coverage and finer-grain US data. See **Roadmap** below.

## Roadmap (build in slices)

Ship one working slice at a time — don't try to build the whole vision before anything works in the browser.

1. **US states + metros (EIA)** — Click a state shape → state-level or PADD regional retail gasoline price. Click one of ~10 metro pins (Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Denver, Houston, LA, Miami, NYC, SF, Seattle) → city retail price. *No backend — direct browser fetch from EIA v2 API.*
2. **EU countries (Oil Bulletin)** — Click an EU country → weekly retail price. *Currently a pre-baked static JSON in `data/eu-prices.json`, refreshed by running `python3 scripts/fetch_eu_prices.py` (needs `pip install openpyxl`). The eventual Hetzner version would just be that same script behind a weekly cron.*
3. **Other countries (GlobalPetrolPrices)** — Click any country → weekly price. *Hetzner scraper runs weekly, caches to JSON. ToS-grey, somewhat fragile.*
4. **US county/city (GasBuddy)** — Click anywhere in the US → nearest station price. *Hetzner headless-browser scraper (Playwright/Puppeteer), behind Cloudflare, ongoing maintenance. The most ambitious slice — defer until earlier ones are solid.*

Currently in: **advertisement automation pipeline + platform**

## Planned features (after slice 4)

Cross-cutting UI work, not new data sources. Build after the four data slices feel stable.

1. **Country/state search bar** in the header — single autocomplete across every clickable shape (US states + EU countries + world countries). On select: pan/zoom to the polygon's bounds and fire its existing click handler so the price popup opens. Reuses every existing fetch path, no new data wiring. Once the news page ships, a search result should also surface recent gas/oil articles mentioning the selected place.

2. **Price heatmap (default)** — Every clickable polygon (US state, EU country, world country) is colored by its current gasoline price on a single global USD/litre scale: green = cheap, yellow ≈ global avg, red = expensive (same convention as the GasBuddy station dots). All borders are white so the heat colors carry the signal uncontested. A legend sits in the bottom-left of the map with min/mid/max labels in the user's selected currency, so "Belgium is orange" actually means something. No opt-in toggle — this is the default appearance.

   **Implementation notes (pending in-browser smoke test):**
   - `scripts/fetch_us_prices.py` resolves all 50 states + DC to a per-state USD/gallon via 14 EIA series (9 state + 5 PADD fallback), writes `data/us-prices.json`. `.github/workflows/refresh-us-prices.yml` runs it Tuesday mornings UTC.
   - `index.html` exposes `priceColor(usdPerLitre)` (HSL green→yellow→red, clamped to [$0.20, $2.20] USD/L) and `paintHeatmap()` which keys US states by name and EU/world by iso2. `paintHeatmap()` is called after each polygon layer's GeoJSON finishes loading, and again from `applyTheme()` so a light/dark flip doesn't wipe colors.
   - Fallback polygons (no matching price entry) keep their per-layer theme fill from `stateStyleFor` / `euStyleFor` / `worldStyleFor`, which now also use the shared `POLYGON_BORDER` (white) and `POLYGON_REST_OPACITY` (0.65) so the look is consistent with priced polygons. Hover bumps opacity to `POLYGON_HOVER_OPACITY` (0.85).
   - Smoke test before declaring done: `python3 -m http.server 8000`, open `http://localhost:8000`, eyeball that (a) US/EU/world all recolor on first paint, (b) borders are white, (c) the bottom-left legend reads sensibly and re-labels when the currency dropdown changes, (d) a light/dark toggle doesn't wipe the colors, (e) GasBuddy station dots still appear past zoom 7. If everything looks blandly yellow, tighten the [MIN,MAX] range; if too much red, widen it.

## Stack
- Plain HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript — no frameworks, no build tools, no `package.json`
- Libraries loaded from CDN in `<head>`: Leaflet (map), Chart.js will be added for charts
- Inline `<style>` and `<script>` blocks inside each HTML file — the user prefers everything in one place

## Data sources
- US prices: [EIA Open Data API](https://www.eia.gov/opendata/) — free, requires per-user API key
- News: [GNews](https://gnews.io/) free tier (100 req/day, 10 articles/request). Picked over NewsAPI because NewsAPI's free tier only serves requests from localhost, which breaks the moment you push to GitHub Pages.

API keys live in browser code for now (personal project, free APIs with low-stakes keys). If the project ever moves beyond personal use, proxy calls through a tiny backend rather than committing keys.

## Running, building, testing
No build, no tests, no lint, no install. Preview by opening `index.html` with the VS Code "Live Server" extension (right-click → Open with Live Server). Note: the frontend fetches `data/*.json`, so you do need a server (Live Server, `python3 -m http.server`, etc.) — opening the file with `file://` will fail those fetches due to browser CORS rules.

To refresh EU prices: `pip install openpyxl` once, then `python3 scripts/fetch_eu_prices.py`. The script downloads the latest EU Weekly Oil Bulletin XLSX, parses it, and overwrites `data/eu-prices.json`. The bulletin updates Thursdays.

## About the user
- Beginner — this is their second project (first was a personal site)
- Comfortable with: plain HTML/CSS/JS, basic Git/GitHub workflow
- New to: `fetch()` / async-await, JSON APIs, charting libraries, map libraries

## How to help
- Explain new concepts in plain English the first time they appear
- When the user makes a mistake, explain *why* it didn't work — don't just fix it silently
- No frameworks, no bundlers, no npm — everything via CDN
- Keep changes small and reviewable; ship one working slice at a time rather than a complete-but-overwhelming change
